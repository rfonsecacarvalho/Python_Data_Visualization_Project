# Final Project: Data Analysis and Visualization
Data visualization project for UBC key capabilities in Data Science Course

## Project Overview

This repository contains my final project, which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization using Python. The project demonstrates my skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling.

### Files in this Repository
1. **Final_Project_EDA.ipynb**: This notebook covers data exploration and cleaning steps, including missing value analysis, descriptive statistics, and feature engineering.
2. **Final_Project_Visualization.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on data visualization using `Altair`, showcasing various types of visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**
- **Altair** (for data visualization)
- **NumPy**

## Project Goals
1. **Perform exploratory data analysis** to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the dataset.
2. **Create interactive visualizations** to present the key findings in an easy-to-understand format.

## Key Results
- Summarized key trends in the dataset through data wrangling.
- Created interactive visualizations that highlight correlations and patterns.
- Found interesting insights related to the project's goals (you can be specific about your insights here).

## Installation and Usage Instructions

To run this project locally, you will need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy altair
